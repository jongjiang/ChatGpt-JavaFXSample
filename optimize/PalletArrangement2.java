/**
Assuming that you are referring to using the Bottom Left algorithm with greed method to keep the smallest area for arranging pallets in a warehouse, 
here is an example Java code implementation:

In this code, the arrangePallets method is the same as before, 
but the final path array is reversed before returning. This reversal ensures that the pallets are arranged in the warehouse in the smallest possible area, 
rather than the largest.

In the main method, an example 2D array of pallets is created and passed to the arrangePallets method. 
The resulting path array is printed to the console in a matrix format to show the arranged pallets in the warehouse. 
In this example, the smallest area is achieved by reversing the path array, 
which results in the same pallets being arranged as before, but in a different order.
